"""
Phase I: Fidelity Sensitivity Profiling.

Defines orthogonal per-layer sensitivity signals:
  - I_q(ℓ) : quantization sensitivity (Fidelity demand)
  - I_r(ℓ) : task adaptation capacity (Plasticity demand)

These signals are *orthogonal* by construction: layers requiring high
precision do not necessarily require high adapter rank, and vice-versa.
This orthogonality motivates the joint optimization in Phases II and III.

class Importance:
    """Orthogonal sensitivity profiles for quantization and adaptation.

    Per paper Section 3.1:
      * ``I_q(ℓ)`` — Fidelity sensitivity, measured as degradation of the
        backbone task loss when layer ℓ is heavily quantized.
      * ``I_r(ℓ)`` — Plasticity demand, measured as adaptation gain from
        allocating additional LoRA rank at layer ℓ.

    Both signals are min-max normalized to [0, 1] and, optionally, combined
    into a single scalar score ``I(ℓ) = w_q · I_q(ℓ) + w_r · I_r(ℓ)`` for
    legacy components that consume a unified signal.

    ----------
    bb : np.ndarray

    w_bb : float
        Weight of the backbone signal in the combined score.
    w_lr : float
        Weight of the LoRA signal in the combined score.
